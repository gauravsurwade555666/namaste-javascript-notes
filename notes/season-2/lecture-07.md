## Currying in Java Script

Currying in JavaScript is a technique where a function, instead of taking all arguments at once, takes the first one and returns a new function that takes the next argument, and so on, until all arguments have been provided. 
The final function then executes with all the arguments.

## Why Use Currying?
- It helps create reusable and more flexible functions.
- It allows partial application of functions (pre-filling some arguments).
Example
Without Currying

```js
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

console.log(add(1, 2, 3)); // 6
```
